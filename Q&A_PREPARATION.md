## üîß Technical Implementation

### Python AI Engine

#### Q: How does the AI make intelligent moves?
**A:**
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Recursive search for optimal moves
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes search by cutting off unnecessary branches
- **Difficulty Levels**: 
  - Easy: 30% optimal moves, 70% random
  - Medium: 60% optimal moves, 40% random  
  - Hard: 90% optimal moves, 10% random

#### Q: What's the board representation?
**A:**
```python
# 3x3 array where:
# 0 = Empty cell
# -1 = X player  
# 1 = O player
board = [[-1, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
```

#### Q: How do you handle game state validation?
**A:**
- Input validation for 3x3 board size

#### Q: What's the database schema?
**A:**
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  password_hash TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME
);

-- Games table  
CREATE TABLE games (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER,
  game_state TEXT,
